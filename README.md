Feature flags for Elixir, configured **entirely at runtime**, with an
**async-safe test layer**.

Bandera supports the full gate model (boolean, actor, group, and percentage
rollouts), backed by in-memory, Ecto, or Redis storage, with an ETS cache and
cross-node cache-busting notifications.

## Why Bandera?

Two things it's built to get right:

**1. Runtime config, no recompilation.** Bandera reads every setting at runtime
through `Application.get_env/3` and never touches `Application.compile_env/3`.
Compile-time config gets baked into artifacts: change a value and you recompile,
and `mix release`'s `:validate_compile_env` check refuses to boot when
`config/runtime.exs` overrides a compile-time key. Here, cache, TTL, persistence
adapter, Ecto table name, and notifications all live in `config/runtime.exs`, and
`Bandera.reload_config/0` applies changes live. Resolved config is cached in
`:persistent_term`, so hot-path reads stay fast.

**2. Async-safe testing, no global bleed or deadlocks.** Flag state is normally
global (shared ETS or a database row), so toggling a flag in one test leaks into
others. That forces flag tests to run `async: false`, and writing flags inside
the Ecto SQL sandbox can deadlock. Bandera ships a **process-scoped test layer**:
overrides are scoped to the test process (and its spawned tasks), so tests run
`async: true` without interfering, never touch the database, and clean up
automatically when the test process exits. See [Testing](#testing).

## Installation

Add `bandera` to your dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:bandera, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Then fetch it:

```bash
mix deps.get
```

Out of the box Bandera uses an in-memory (ETS) store, so it works with no
further setup for development and single-node use. The persistence and
notification backends are optional dependencies; add only the ones you use:

```elixir
{:ecto_sql, "~> 3.10"},        # Ecto persistence (plus a DB driver, e.g. :postgrex)
{:redix, "~> 1.1"},            # Redis persistence and/or Redis PubSub notifications
{:phoenix_pubsub, "~> 2.1"},   # Phoenix.PubSub cross-node notifications
{:nimble_ownership, "~> 1.0", only: :test}  # required for the test layer
```

## Configuration

All configuration is read at runtime, so you can place it in
`config/runtime.exs` (or any config file). Everything has a default; this is
only needed to change a backend.

```elixir
config :bandera,
  cache: [enabled: true, ttl: 900],
  persistence: [
    adapter: Bandera.Store.Persistent.Ecto,
    repo: MyApp.Repo,
    ecto_table_name: "bandera_flags"
  ],
  cache_bust_notifications: [
    enabled: true,
    adapter: Bandera.Notifications.PhoenixPubSub,
    client: MyApp.PubSub
  ]
```

Defaults if you configure nothing: in-memory store, cache on (900s TTL),
notifications off. Call `Bandera.reload_config/0` to re-read config at runtime.

### Using the Ecto store

If you choose the Ecto adapter, create the flags table with a migration:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.CreateBanderaFlags do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def up, do: Bandera.Ecto.Migrations.up()
  def down, do: Bandera.Ecto.Migrations.down()
end
```

The table name is read from your runtime config (default `"bandera_flags"`).

## Usage

Once installed, the whole API lives on the `Bandera` module.

```elixir
# Simple on/off
Bandera.enable(:checkout)          #=> {:ok, true}
Bandera.enabled?(:checkout)        #=> true
Bandera.disable(:checkout)         #=> {:ok, false}

# Per actor (pass `for:` to check)
Bandera.enable(:beta, for_actor: "user-1")
Bandera.enabled?(:beta, for: "user-1")   #=> true
Bandera.enabled?(:beta, for: "user-2")   #=> false

# Per group
Bandera.enable(:beta, for_group: :staff)
Bandera.enabled?(:beta, for: %{groups: [:staff]})  #=> true

# Percentage rollout (ratio between 0.0 and 1.0)
Bandera.enable(:gradual, for_percentage_of: {:actors, 0.25})
Bandera.enable(:gradual, for_percentage_of: {:time, 0.10})

# Remove gates / introspect
Bandera.clear(:checkout)           #=> :ok   (removes the whole flag)
Bandera.clear(:beta, for_actor: "user-1")
Bandera.all_flag_names()           #=> {:ok, [:beta]}
Bandera.get_flag(:beta)            #=> {:ok, %Bandera.Flag{...}}
```

`enabled?/2` always returns a boolean. A missing flag (or a store error,
which is logged) resolves to `false`.

### Actors and groups

An actor is anything with a stable string id; a group is a named bucket an actor
can belong to. Bandera ships implementations for binaries, integers, and maps
(`:id` / `:groups` keys). For your own structs, implement the protocols:

```elixir
defimpl Bandera.Actor, for: MyApp.User do
  def id(user), do: "user:#{user.id}"
end

defimpl Bandera.Group, for: MyApp.User do
  def in?(user, group_name), do: group_name in user.roles
end
```

## Multivariate flags

Instead of a binary on/off, a flag can return one of N named variants. Actors
are assigned a variant by a stable SHA-256 hash (same actor + flag → same
variant across nodes and restarts), weighted proportionally:

```elixir
# Create a 50/50 A/B test
Bandera.put_variants(:hero_cta, %{"control" => 1, "treatment" => 1})

# Resolve which variant the current user sees
variant = Bandera.variant(:hero_cta, for: current_user)
# => "control" or "treatment", same value for the same user every time

# Fallback when the flag is missing or has no variant gate
Bandera.variant(:hero_cta, default: "control")

# Weighted split: 10% treatment, 90% control
Bandera.put_variants(:checkout, %{"control" => 9, "new_flow" => 1})
```

`variant/2` returns `nil` (or `options[:default]`) when the flag does not exist
or has no variant gate. The actor bucketing is identical to the one used by
`percentage_of_actors` gates — an actor's position in the weight range is
deterministic but different per flag.

## Targeting rules & segments

Flags can target arbitrary attributes in an **evaluation context** map — without
deploying code. Rules are stored as data in the flags table.

### Context-based rules

Pass a `context:` map to `enabled?/2` and use `enable(flag, when: constraints)`
to define which context values grant access:

```elixir
# Enable only for premium US users
Bandera.enable(:new_billing,
  when: [
    {"plan", :eq, "premium"},
    {"country", :eq, "US"}
  ]
)

# All constraints must match (AND semantics)
Bandera.enabled?(:new_billing, context: %{"plan" => "premium", "country" => "US"})
#=> true

Bandera.enabled?(:new_billing, context: %{"plan" => "free", "country" => "US"})
#=> false
```

Supported operators: `:eq`, `:neq`, `:in`, `:not_in`, `:contains`, `:gt`,
`:gte`, `:lt`, `:lte`, `:matches` (regex).

### Reusable segments

Define a **segment** once and reference it from many flags:

```elixir
# Store a named set of constraints
Bandera.put_segment(:premium_us, [
  {"plan", :eq, "premium"},
  {"country", :eq, "US"}
])

# Enable flags by referencing the segment
Bandera.enable(:new_billing, for_segment: :premium_us)
Bandera.enable(:advanced_reports, for_segment: :premium_us)

# Check is the same — pass context:
Bandera.enabled?(:new_billing, context: %{"plan" => "premium", "country" => "US"})
#=> true
```

Segment constraints are expanded at evaluation time; changing a segment's rules
automatically affects every flag that references it.

### Evaluation precedence

When `:for` and `:context` are both present, precedence is:
actor gates → group gates → rule/segment gates → boolean gate → percentage gates.

### Migrating an existing Ecto install (schema v2)

If you already have the Bandera flags table and want to add variant support,
run this one-time helper from a new migration:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Repo.Migrations.BanderaSchemaV2 do
  use Ecto.Migration

  def up, do: Bandera.Ecto.Migrations.upgrade_v2()
  def down, do: :ok
end
```

`upgrade_v2/0` adds the nullable `value` column to an existing table via
`add_if_not_exists`, so it is safe to run even if the column already exists.
New installs calling `Bandera.Ecto.Migrations.up()` get the column automatically.

## Testing

Bandera's test layer scopes flag overrides to the test process (and its
spawned tasks), so tests can run `async: true` without interfering with each
other and without touching the database.

```elixir
# config/test.exs
config :bandera, store: Bandera.Store.ProcessScoped

# test/test_helper.exs
Bandera.Test.start()
```

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.CheckoutTest do
  use ExUnit.Case, async: true
  use Bandera.Test

  @tag feature_flags: [checkout: true]
  test "feature on via tag" do
    assert Bandera.enabled?(:checkout)
  end

  test "toggle in the body" do
    enable_flag(:beta)
    assert Bandera.enabled?(:beta)
  end
end
```

Overrides are cleaned up automatically when the test process exits.

## Fail-open default

By default `enabled?/2` returns `false` when the store is unreachable (the
error is logged). Pass `default: true` to fail open instead:

```elixir
# Returns true if the store is down, false if the flag is simply off.
Bandera.enabled?(:checkout, default: true)

# Works with per-actor checks too.
Bandera.enabled?(:beta, for: current_user, default: true)
```

## Audit log

Bandera includes an opt-in audit hook that turns the built-in write telemetry
into structured change events. Attach it once at startup with a callback:

```elixir
# In your application start/2 or a supervision child:
Bandera.Audit.attach(:my_audit, fn event ->
  MyApp.AuditLog.insert!(%{
    action: event.action,
    flag: event.flag_name,
    actor: event.actor,
    at: event.at
  })
end)
```

The callback receives a `%Bandera.Audit.Event{}` on every `enable/2`,
`disable/2`, or `clear/2` call. Pass `:by` to the write functions to record
who made the change:

```elixir
Bandera.enable(:checkout, by: current_user.email)
Bandera.disable(:beta, for_actor: %{id: 1}, by: "admin@example.com")
```

Call `Bandera.Audit.detach/1` with the same handler id to stop receiving events:

```elixir
Bandera.Audit.detach(:my_audit)
```

## Stale flags

Bandera can tell you which flags haven't been evaluated recently, so you can
prune flags that are no longer in use.

Start `Bandera.Usage` in your supervision tree and call `attach/0` once at
boot:

```elixir
# In your application start/2:
children = [
  # ... your other children ...
  Bandera.Usage
]
Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)

# After the supervisor starts:
Bandera.Usage.attach()
```

Then query stale flags from IEx or a scheduled job:

```elixir
# Flags not evaluated in the past 30 days (default):
Bandera.stale_flags()

# Custom window:
Bandera.stale_flags(older_than: 60)
```

Or use the Mix task from the command line:

```bash
# List all flags:
mix bandera.flags

# List stale flags (not evaluated in 30 days):
mix bandera.flags --stale

# Custom window:
mix bandera.flags --stale --older-than 60
```

`Bandera.Usage` is opt-in: nothing breaks when it is not started —
`stale_flags/1` simply treats every flag as stale.

## Telemetry

Bandera emits `:telemetry` events for reads (`[:bandera, :enabled?]`), writes
(`[:bandera, :enable | :disable | :clear]`), and the persistence layer. Attach
your own handlers to measure flag usage and store latency.

## Dashboard (optional)

Bandera includes an optional LiveView dashboard to browse and manage flags —
grouped, searchable, with full per-gate control. It ships in the core library and
activates only when your app depends on `phoenix_live_view`. It ships no
JavaScript and needs no asset-pipeline changes — it inherits your layout and runs
on your existing LiveView socket. Mount it behind your own admin auth:

    import Bandera.Dashboard.Router

    scope "/admin" do
      pipe_through [:browser, :require_admin]
      bandera_dashboard "/flags"
    end

See the [Dashboard guide](guides/dashboard_guide.md) for details.
